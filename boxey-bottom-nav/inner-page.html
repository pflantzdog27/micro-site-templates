        <h1>Walter, you've been busy. You wanna put your arms out to the sides for me if you would?</h1>
        <p>I don't think we're alike at all, Mr. White. You are not a cautious man at all. Your partner was late and he was high. He's high often, isn't he? You have poor judgement. I can't work with someone with poor judgement. I've been told, it's excellent. That is not the only factor. I have to ask... why? Why him? How much product do you have on hand? I have your numbers. You can never trust a drug addict.</p>
        <p>Has your condition worsened? Your medical condition, has it grown worse? Is there a ringing in your ears? Are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices? No, clearly you are not. No rational person would do as you have done. Explain yourself. Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child? Where is Pinkman now.</p>
        <p>I handle the business operations. With all due respect, Don Eladio. I didn't sell it to them. I gave them samples. I gave them samples to give to you. To introduce you to our product. This product is the drug of the future. It'll triple your profits. Perhaps quadruple.</p>
        <p>Right now, you deal almost exclusively in cocaine. But the coca plant can't grow in Mexico. You are no more than middlemen for the Colombians. They cut you a percentage for smuggling across the border. But the lion's share of the profit goes to them, despite your assumption of all the risk. And you keep all the profits. </p>
